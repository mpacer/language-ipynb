# language-ipynb

Adds support for IPython notebook (`.ipynb`) files.

At the moment, this just includes the JSON language source and adds `.ipynb` as a file extension.

## TODO

* Similar to the markdown support, create a preview mode that uses nbconvert to render HTML.
* Highlight IPython notebook specifics
